### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Unexpected or Suspicious Process Executions within Pods.

Unexpected or suspicious process executions within pods are a common occurrence in software development. These incidents occur when processes are executed within pods that are not part of the expected application behavior. This type of incident can lead to security risks, system instability, and data loss. To mitigate these risks, alerts are triggered to notify software engineers of any unexpected or suspicious process executions.

### Parameters

```shell
export NAMESPACE="PLACEHOLDER"
export POD_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
export POLICY_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Get a list of all pods in the affected namespace

```shell
kubectl get pods -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

### Inspect the logs for a specific pod to see if there are any suspicious process executions

```shell
kubectl logs ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

### Check if any unauthorized processes are running within a pod

```shell
kubectl exec ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE} ps -ef
```

### Check the network connections for a specific pod to see if there are any suspicious connections

```shell
kubectl exec ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE} netstat -tulpn
```

### Check the pod's environment variables to see if there are any unexpected variables that could be causing issues

```shell
kubectl exec ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE} env
```

### Check the pod's configuration to see if there are any issues or misconfigurations

```shell
kubectl describe pod ${POD_NAME} -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

## Repair

### Implement security measures like network policies, container isolation, and pod security policies to prevent unauthorized process execution within the pods.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Define the parameters
namespace=${NAMESPACE}
pod=${POD_NAME}
policy=${POLICY_NAME}

# Implement network policies to restrict traffic to the pod
kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml -n $namespace

# Implement pod security policies to restrict the pod's privileges
kubectl apply -f pod-security-policy.yaml

# Update the pod's security context to enforce the new policies
kubectl patch pod $pod -n $namespace -p '{"spec":{"securityContext":{"runAsNonRoot":true,"runAsUser":1000,"fsGroup":1000,"seLinuxOptions":{"level":"s0:c123,c456"}}}}'

# Verify that the policies are enforced
kubectl auth can-i create deployment -n $namespace --as system:serviceaccount:$namespace:$policy
```
